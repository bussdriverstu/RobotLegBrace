## FAQs
### What plans do you have in the future for this project?
I have some ideas for reintegrating the muscle sensors back into the leg to have more accurate bend timings. I'd also like to program different gait modes for different terrain (hiking, uneven ground, etc).

### How long did this take?
I started the fall of 2021 after being ghosted by a company in San Franscico that makes warehouse exoskeletons. They wanted to expand into the medical field and I volunteered to be a guinea pig. After a few conversations with the CEO I never heard from them again. I assume I lived too far away to make this feasible and they found better candidates. It took me a few months before I started testing it on myself, a little over a year to get it to the point where I could hike with it.

### What is your injury and why is it so difficult to find a therapy?
I had a tumor in my spinal cord. Because it wasn't the result of a tramatic injury, therapies like stem cells are riskier for me. I assume this is because they'd rather avoid growing another tumor, but I don't know. In addition, most robot knee assist devices out there target people who can't hold their weight with their leg, i.e. they can bend but can not straighten their leg. e.g. [The C Brace is one of these devices that I had a consultation with.](https://www.ottobock.com/en-us/c-brace). I have the opposite problem and haven't been able to find a solution so far. After years of frustration, I just decided to try to build my own.

### Why don't you patent this or sell it?
I believe in universal healthcare and have suffered from the ill-effects of for-profit healthcare for a long time. Anyone who has fought with insurance knows the phrase "medically necessary" all too well. Maybe I'm bitter, but I'd rather help people like me for free than join the profit model. Besides, this thing is jank; No one should build it let alone buy it. It works for me and that's good enough. I posted it here in case anyone out there wants to improve it or adapt it for their own needs. That said, you can donate to me or buy me a cup of coffee via bitcoin/ethereum here:
